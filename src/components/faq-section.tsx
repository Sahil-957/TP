        question: "Do I need any technical knowledge to use this?",
        answer: "No. We set everything up for you. You get a simple way to view leads and, if needed, a short walkthrough on how to manage minor changes."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you integrate with tools I already use?",
        answer: "Yes. Through n8n, we can connect to many popular tools like Google Workspace, CRMs, email services, and messaging APIs, depending on your stack."
    },
    {
        question: "Will the AI agent say incorrect things?",
        answer: "We carefully configure and test the assistant based on your content, FAQs, and rules. You can always request adjustments as we observe real conversations."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does the setup take?",
        answer: "Typically, from initial consultation to going live takes 2-4 weeks, depending on the complexity of your automations and the amount of content we need to prepare."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I want to make changes after launch?",
        answer: "We provide ongoing support. You can request changes to flows, responses, integrations, and website content. We'll implement them and test before updating your live system."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption, secure APIs, and follow best practices for data handling. You maintain full control over what data the AI collects and stores."
